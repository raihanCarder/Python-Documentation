            <p>Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py)
                files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed. Let's write
                our first Python file, called hello.py, which can be done in any text editor:</p>
            <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
            <p>Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your
                file, and run. That is how you print something on Python.</p>

        <section id="Comments" class="main-section">
            <header>Comments</header>
            <p>Comments can be used to explain Python code.
                Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
                Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.<br>Comments starts with a #, and Python
                will ignore them:</p>
            <code>#This is a comment <br>print("Hello, World!")</code>
            <p>Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line.A comment does
                not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code.

        <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value
                to it. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after
                they have been set.</p>
            <code>x = 5 <br>y = "John" <br >print(x) <br>print(y)</code>
            <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have
                been set.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Data_Types" class="main-section">
            <header>Data Types</header>
            <p>
                In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can store data of different types, and
                different types can do different things. Python has the following data types built-in by default, in
                these categories: <br><br>
                <i>Text Type:</i> str <br>
                <i>Numeric Type:</i> int, float, complex<br>
                <i>Mapping Type:</i> Dict<br>
                <i>Set Types:</i> set, frozenset<br>
                <i>Boolean Type:</i> bool<br>
                <i>Binary Type:</i> bytes, bytearray, memoryview<br>
                <i>None Type:</i> NoneType.<br><br>
                The type() function tells you what data type a variable is a part of:
            </p> <code>x=5 <br> type(x) </code>
            <p>The code above would show you what type of data type x is.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="If_Else" class="main-section">
            <header>If Else</header>
            <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics which can be seen <a
                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp">here</a>. An "if statement" is written
                by using the if keyword.</p>
            <code>a=3<br> b=200<br>if b > a:<br>
  &emsp;print("b is greater than a")
</code>

            <p>In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether
                b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to
                screen that "b is greater than a". Another thing to keep in mind is that Python relies on indentation
                (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often
                use curly-brackets for this purpose. The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the
                preceding conditions:
            </p>
            <code>a=3<br> b=200<br>if b > a:<br>
  &emsp;print("b is greater than a")<br>else:
    <br> &emsp;print("a is greater than b")
</code>
            <p>In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not true, so we go to the else condition
                and print to screen that "a is greater than b".</p>
        </section>
        <section id="For_Loops" class="main-section">
            <header>For Loops</header>
            <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or
                a string).

                This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method
                as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

                With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

            </p><code>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
for x in fruits:<br>
  &emsp;print(x)</code>
            <p>The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="While_Loops" class="main-section">
            <header>While loops</header>
            <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>
            <code>i = 1<br>
while i < 6:<br>
  &emsp;print(i)<br>
  &emsp;i += 1</code>
            <p>The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing
                variable, i, which we set to 1.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Functions" class="main-section">
            <header>Functions</header>
            <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
                You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
                A function can return data as a result. In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:
            </p><code>def my_function():<br>
  &emsp;print("Hello from a function")</code>
            <p>
                To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
            </p><code>def my_function():<br>
  &emsp;print("Hello from a function")<br><br>my_function()
</code>
            <p>Arguments can be passed on in the function call if your function defintion includes parameters.</p>
